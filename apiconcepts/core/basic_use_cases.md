The basic use cases and features will be explained using an example application. The application is a very simple console application that allows the user to send a message using a message transmitter of his choice. The requirement is that these message transmitters should be pluggable.

The following topics will be covered:

* Defining an Extension Point: Defining an extension point so the host application can receive extensions.
* Creating Extensions: Developing an extension for a specific extension point.
