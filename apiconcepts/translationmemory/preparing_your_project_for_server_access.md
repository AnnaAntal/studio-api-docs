Preparing your Project for Server Access
=====

Using server TMs programmatically requires you to add some more references to your project.

To enable a project for server TM access you need to make sure that the following references are available:


* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.ServerBasedTranslationMemory.Contracts
In summary, make sure that your project uses all of the following references:

<img style="display:block; " src="images/AllReferences.jpg"/>

Also, make sure that from this point forward your classes use the following namespaces:

* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemoryApi
* Sdl.LanguagePlatform.TranslationMemory
